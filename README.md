# HirstPainting

Inspired by the lovely Damien Hirst, using this code you can create your own spot painting (and potentially sell it for $19 million dollars :)). 

The code that is commented out is the process of using the colorgram package to extract the exact colors from the hirst.jpg photo. I left the code in so feel free to uncomment the code and use your own .jpg file to get the exact color palette you want from any photo you choose. I copied the list from the terminal and made a new list (color_palette2) and deleted out the colors that ended in 200's because they are very light or white color. Have fun!
